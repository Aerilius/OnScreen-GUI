• Make the toolkit flexible enough to work in 3d => 
  :width, :height, :depth, size=Geom::Vector3d(x,y,z), 
  :left, :right, :top, :bottom, :front, :back, 
  :marginFront, :marginBack, :paddingFront, :paddingBack ...
  
• allow widgets/elements to break out of relative 2d screen space layout, 
  connected to Vertex/Point3d/DrawingElement instead of screen space ORIGIN.
  Should this be in :position = :absolute | :relative | Geom::Point3d
  Or new property? Or property of the "Window" element? Rename "Window" in "drawing space" ?
  
• Make it easier to create complex widgets (like the slider). They are currently 
  difficult to code.
  A better approach is a "composite widget" that is a sort of container with an 
  additional "hidden" set of embedded children widgets.
  embedded children widgets. These would be positioned by the layout engine and 
  you don't need to handle positions/sizes:
  • in case of the slider: a label for the name, a label of the minimum value,
    a long bar (horiz. or vert.), a movable button, a label for the maximum value
  • in case of dialogs/windows:
    embedded: a rectangular title bar + a dialog border (where you could resize the dialog),
    a container where you could add any other widgets (the content of the dialog)
